  <h1>More Physics, Less Math</h1>

  <p>
    Physics is about understanding what is happening in the world.
    This website is a place to write ideas, explanations, and physical
    intuition without worrying about equations or formatting.
  </p>

  <h2>Diffraction</h2>

  <p>
    Today we will try to understand the concept of diffraction, the different types of diffraction, and its relation to Fourier optics.
    We will also see how a lens allows us to observe diffraction patterns in a simple and intuitive way.
    To begin with, you should be familiar with Huygens' wave theory and the basic idea of interference.
    Some familiarity with wave vectors, wavelength, and the exponential representation of light waves will be helpful, but we will focus mainly on the physical picture rather than mathematical details.
    Interference occurs whenever two or more waves overlap.
    At any point in space, the total electric field is obtained by adding the electric field vectors of the individual waves.
    Depending on their relative phases, this vector sum can lead to constructive interference, destructive interference, or something in between.
  </p>

  <p>
    Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase.
    In this case, the peaks and troughs of the waves align, and the resulting
    electric field has a larger amplitude.
  </p>

  <p>
    Destructive interference occurs when the waves are out of phase by \(\pi\).
    Here, the peak of one wave coincides with the trough of another, and the
    resulting electric field can be reduced or even cancel completely.
  </p>

  <p>
    More generally, the phase difference between waves determines how strongly
    they interfere.
    A phase difference of \(2\pi\) corresponds to the same physical phase,
    while a phase difference of \(\pi\) corresponds to maximum opposition.
    For interference to produce visible fringes, the waves must share a common polarization direction.
    Since the electric field is a vector quantity, only parallel field components can add constructively or destructively.
    If two waves are polarized perpendicular to each other, their fields cannot cancel or reinforce, and no interference fringes are observed.
    In intermediate cases, where the polarizations are not perfectly parallel, only the parallel component contributes to interference, resulting in fringes with reduced contrast.
  </p>

  <p>
    Diffraction is the bending or spreading of waves when they encounter obstacles or pass through narrow openings.
    Unlike reflection or refraction, diffraction cannot be explained by simple ray optics; it is a purely wave phenomenon.
  </p>

  <p>
    The effect becomes significant when the size of the obstacle or slit is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.
    It leads to patterns of constructive and destructive interference, creating bright and dark regions on a screen.
    Diffraction shows that light and other waves have a wave nature, not just a particle-like behavior.
  </p>

  <p>
    If light were purely a particle, it would travel straight through a single slit without spreading.
    But when the slit width is comparable to the wavelength, we observe an interference pattern—an effect beautifully explained by Huygens’ principle, which treats every point on a wavefront as a secondary source of spherical waves.
  </p>

  <h2>Near-field and Far-field Diffraction</h2>

  <p>
    Diffraction can be studied in two regimes: <strong>near field (Fresnel)</strong> and <strong>far field (Fraunhofer)</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Near Field (Fresnel)</h3>

  <p>
    In the near field, a point \(P\) on the screen receives light from the slit along <em>non-parallel rays</em>.
    The path difference between these rays is not simple (\(\Delta s \neq d \sin \theta\)) and varies with position on the screen,
    making calculations more complex, even though the overall diffraction pattern remains unchanged.
  </p>

  <h3>Far Field (Fraunhofer)</h3>

  <p>
    If the screen is very far from the slit, the rays reaching a point \(P\) can be approximated as <em>parallel</em>,
    especially if the slit is very narrow.
    In this case, each point on the screen corresponds to a particular direction of rays from the slit.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the slit is extremely narrow, it can be modeled as containing only <strong>two point sources</strong>, producing a simple interference pattern.
    As the slit width increases, more point sources fit inside, each emitting spherical waves.
    The superposition of these waves leads to constructive interference along certain directions, forming <em>planar wavefronts with slightly curved ends</em>, which produce the observed diffraction pattern.
  </p>

  <h2>Effect of Wavelength on Diffraction Patterns</h2>

  <p>
    If we model the slit as a collection of point sources, a smaller wavelength \(\lambda\) is analogous to having more <em>effective sources</em> per unit length of the slit,
    because the wavefront can support finer spatial features.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can play around with the simulation at
    <a href="https://iwant2study.org/lookangejss/04waves_11superposition/ejss_model_T24_Diffraction/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      this interactive applet
    </a>
    and observe how the diffraction patterns evolve as you vary the slit width and the wavelength.
  </p>

  <p>
    At a point \(P\) on the screen, the intensity can be thought of as the sum of contributions from all point sources across the slit.
    Since the sources are continuous and infinitesimally small, their contributions can be integrated as \(e^{ikr}\), where \(r\) can be expressed in terms of the slit position \(x\), from the start of the slit at \(x=0\) to the end at \(x=b\).
  </p>

  <p>
    At a point \(P\) on the screen, the intensity can be thought of as the sum of contributions from all point sources across the slit.
    Since the sources are continuous and infinitesimally small, their contributions can be integrated as \(e^{ikr}\), where \(r\) can be expressed in terms of the slit position \(x\), from the start of the slit at \(x=0\) to the end at \(x=b\):
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r = \sqrt{x^2 + d^2}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    The distance from a point on the slit to point \(P\) is
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r = \sqrt{d^2 + x^2} = d \sqrt{1 + \frac{x^2}{d^2}}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    For \(d \gg x\) (far-field), we can approximate using a binomial expansion:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r \approx d \left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{2 d^2} \right) = d + \frac{x^2}{2d}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    For \(d \gg x\) (far-field), we can approximate using a binomial expansion:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r \approx d \left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{2 d^2} \right) = d + \frac{x^2}{2d}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    For \(d \gg x\) (far-field), we can approximate using a binomial expansion:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r \approx d \left( 1 + \frac{x^2}{2 d^2} \right) = d + \frac{x^2}{2d}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    Thus, the phase factor becomes
  </p>

  <p>\[
  e^{ikr} \approx e^{ikd} e^{i k \frac{x^2}{2d}}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    The contribution from each point on the slit can be written as a spherical wave:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(r) = \frac{E}{r} e^{ikr}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    Since the screen distance \(d\) is much greater than the slit coordinate \(x\) (\(d \gg x\)), the amplitude factor \(1/r \approx 1/d\) can be taken out of the integral with very little error.
    Only the phase varies significantly.
    Therefore, the total field at \(P\) can be approximated as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(P) \approx \frac{E}{d} \int_0^b e^{ik r(x)} \, dx \approx \frac{Ee^{ikd}}{d} \int_0^b e^{i k \frac{x^2}{2d}} \, dx.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    Although the amplitude factor \(1/r \approx 1/d\) is nearly constant, the term inside the exponential, \(e^{ikr}\), is very sensitive to small changes in \(r\).
    Even tiny variations in the path length \(r\) lead to significant differences in phase.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since the screen distance \(d\) is much greater than the slit coordinate \(x\) (\(d \gg x\)), the amplitude factor \(1/r \approx 1/d\) can be taken out of the integral with very little error.
    Only the phase varies significantly.
    In the very far-field (Fraunhofer) limit, the spherical waves from the slit can be considered as parallel rays, and the path difference for a point at position \(x\) on the slit is approximated linearly as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  \Delta r \approx x \sin \theta,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    where \(\theta\) is the angle between the optical axis and the point on the screen.
    Therefore, the total distance can be written as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r(x) \approx d - x \sin \theta,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    and the phase factor becomes
  </p>

  <p>\[
  e^{ikr(x)} \approx e^{ikd} e^{-ik x \sin \theta}.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    The total field at point \(P\) on the screen is then
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(P) \approx \frac{E}{d} \int_0^b e^{-ik x \sin \theta} \, dx.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> In the Fraunhofer limit, the amplitude is nearly constant (\(1/d\)), while the phase varies linearly with \(x\).
    This linear phase variation across the slit produces the interference and diffraction pattern observed on the screen.
  </p>

  <h2>Fourier transform</h2>

  <p>
    We can model a single slit of width \(b\) as a transmission function \(A(x)\) along the \(x\)-axis:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  A(x) =
  \begin{cases}
  1, & -b/2 \le x \le b/2, \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \]</p>

  <p>
    By extending \(A(x)\) to be zero outside the slit (\(-\infty \to \infty\)), the Fraunhofer diffraction integral can be written as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(\theta) \propto \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(x) \, e^{-ik x \sin \theta} \, dx.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    Comparing this with the definition of a one-dimensional Fourier transform
  </p>

  <p>\[
  \tilde{A}(k_x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(x) \, e^{-i k_x x} \, dx,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    we can identify the transverse wavevector component
  </p>

  <p>\[
  k_x =  k \sin \theta.
  \]</p>

  <p>
    Thus, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is the Fourier transform of the aperture function \(A(x)\), and the diffraction angle \(\theta\) maps directly to the transverse wavevector \(k_x\).
  </p>

  <p>
    For a rectangular slit, evaluating the integral gives the familiar sinc function:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(\theta) \propto \frac{\sin \left( \frac{k b}{2} \sin \theta \right)}{\frac{k b}{2} \sin \theta} = \text{sinc}\left( \frac{k b}{2} \sin \theta \right).
  \]</p>

  <p>
    In the very far-field (Fraunhofer) limit, each point on the screen effectively receives contributions from rays that are nearly parallel.
    In the Fraunhofer (very far-field) approximation, if the observation point \(P\) lies on the central axis (\(\theta = 0\)), all rays from different points along the slit are effectively parallel and travel the same distance to the screen.
    Therefore, the path length from any point on the slit to \(P\) can be approximated as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r \approx d,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    and the phase is nearly the same for all contributions, giving rise to the central maximum.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a point \(P\) away from the central axis (\(\theta \neq 0\)), such as \(\theta = 30^\circ\), rays from different positions along the slit travel different distances to the screen.
    For instance, the top of the slit may travel a slightly shorter path than the bottom.
    This results in a path difference
  </p>

  <p>\[
  \Delta r \approx x \sin \theta,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    which produces phase differences across the slit and leads to the interference and diffraction pattern observed on the screen.
  </p>

  <h3>Observation at an off-axis point (\(\theta \neq 0\))</h3>

  <p>
    Consider a point \(P\) above the central axis, for example at \(\theta = 30^\circ\).
    Rays originating from different points along the slit are effectively parallel in the far-field (Fraunhofer) limit, but they do not travel the same distance to reach \(P\).
    Let \(x\) measure the position along the slit, with \(x>0\) at the top and \(x<0\) at the bottom.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Path lengths:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Top of the slit (\(x>0\)) → shorter path to \(P\)</li>
    <li>Center of the slit (\(x=0\)) → path \(= d\)</li>
    <li>Bottom of the slit (\(x<0\)) → longer path to \(P\)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even though the rays start from different positions along the slit, they converge at the same point \(P\) on the screen, allowing us to treat the contributions as parallel rays.
    In the Fraunhofer approximation, the path length from a point \(x\) on the slit to \(P\) can be written as
  </p>

  <p>\[
  r(x) \approx d - x \sin \theta,
  \]</p>

  <p>
    which captures the linear phase variation across the slit that gives rise to interference and diffraction patterns.
  </p>

  <h2>Role of the Lens in Fraunhofer Diffraction</h2>

  <p>
    The lens takes the parallel rays from different points on the slit and focuses them to a single point, providing a geometric shortcut that allows the approximated Fraunhofer diffraction pattern to be observed at its focal plane without requiring the screen to be infinitely far away.
  </p>

  <h3>The Physical Effect</h3>

  <p>
    The lens has a remarkable property: <strong>it forces all parallel rays to meet at one point</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rays leaving different points on the slit <strong>at the same angle \(\theta\)</strong> are parallel to each other.</li>
    <li>The lens focuses all such parallel rays to <strong>one spot</strong> on its focal plane.</li>
    <li>The path difference between these parallel rays is \(x \tan\theta\), which for small angles approximates to \(\Delta x \sin\theta\).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    So: <strong>different angles → different spots</strong> on the focal plane.
  </p>

  <h3>The Mathematical Trick</h3>

  <p>
    The lens has a special property described by the phase factor:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  t_{\text{lens}}(x) = e^{-i\frac{k}{2f}x^2}
  \]</p>

  <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Light from slit to lens (distance \(d\)) gets Fresnel phase:
      \[
      e^{+i\frac{k}{2d}x^2}
      \]
    </li>
    <li>
      The lens multiplies by:
      \[
      e^{-i\frac{k}{2f}x^2}
      \]
    </li>
    <li>
      If we choose \(d = f\) (slit at the lens's front focal point):
      \[
      e^{+i\frac{k}{2f}x^2} \times e^{-i\frac{k}{2f}x^2} = 1
      \]
      The \(x^2\) terms <strong>cancel completely</strong>!
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What's Left After Cancellation?</h3>

  <p>
    After the \(x^2\) cancellation, the phase depends only on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(x\) (slit position)</li>
    <li>Spot position on screen \(X\) (which equals \(f\theta\))</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The math simplifies to:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E(\text{spot at position } P) \propto \int A(x) e^{-ikx(X/f)} \, dx
  \]</p>

  <p>
    But \(X/f = \theta \approx \sin\theta\) for small angles, so:
  </p>

  <p>\[
  E \propto \int A(x) e^{-ikx\sin\theta} \, dx
  \]</p>

  <p>
    <strong>This is EXACTLY the Fraunhofer formula!</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>The Key Insight</h3>

  <p>
    We are trying to make parallel rays with \(x\sin\theta\) path difference interfere.
    Without a lens:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>We need the screen at infinity for rays to be parallel.</li>
    <li>The \(x\sin\theta\) phase emerges naturally at infinity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    With a lens:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The lens <strong>artificially creates</strong> approximate \(x\sin\theta\) phase relationship.</li>
    <li>It does this by canceling the near-field \(x^2\) phase distortions.</li>
    <li>The focal plane acts like "infinity brought close".</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The lens transforms the problem from "wait until infinity to see parallel rays" to "I'll make parallel rays meet right here at my focal plane."
    wallaahh Lens does the Fourier Transform.
